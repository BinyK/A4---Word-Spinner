Original : In the past, sailors did not have modern technology to navigate their way. Therefore, they determined longitude and direction based on the positions and movements of constellations, and planned routes accordingly. The main constellations that guided them were the North Star and the Big Dipper. The North Star, in particular, was used for navigation since it closely aligns with the Earth's axis of rotation, always pointing in the same direction in the northern sky. From ancient times, sailors used the North Star to guide their way. As the North Star rotates around the celestial sphere once every 24 hours, its position can be used to measure time, and since its position changes over the course of a year, it can also be used to measure seasons.
